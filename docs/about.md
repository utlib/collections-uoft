## About Collections U of T
[Collections U of T](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca) is the  University of Toronto Libraries' image repository for digitized special collections and archives. It provides open access to these digital image collections through the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/) and standard metadata formats. 

Collections U of T provides U of T staff:

1. Collection management and digital object storage for university special collections and archives image collections
2. Indexing for digital object metadata
3. Search and discovery for collections and digital objects
4. User management and authentication (CRUD for collections and digital objects)
5. Statistics for collections and digital objects
6. The ability to create "simple pages" for content _about_ collections and items stored in Collections U of T

Collections U of T is *not*:
* A digitization service
* A digital exhibit service
* A digital preservation service
* Currently structured tostore media types other than _image files_. Collections U of T does not currently support .pdf, audio, or video collections
* Open to anyone for use - digital collections must be *assessed* prior to inclusion in Collections U of T. Because the service is intended for providing long term discovery and access for digital image collections, the digital objects must belong to a UTL department or archives for long term care and maintenance purposes. Collections from external organizations must be assessed by a UTL department and acquired via formal agreement with the external organization prior to inclusion in Collections U of T. Note that UTL collection owners are responsible for assessing digital objects for accessibility, privacy and copyright considerations, as well as staffing capacity to support the care and maintenance of the digital collection over time. 

Researchers, students, and faculty can read documentation at https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/help (page not yet published) to learn how to use the system. Please send any questions or feedback to [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca).
