# Transcribing and Annotating Collections U of T Images

This page compiles an ongoing list of transcription and annotation tools that can be used with Collections U of T images. 

For Collections U of T purposes, we are interested in tools that are designed to work with [IIIF](https://iiif.io) and follow the [W3C Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model) - coming out of the [W3C Open Annotations Community](https://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/). 

Collections U of T does not currently support TEI xml. 

Please note: collection owners should only upload final, complete transcriptions into Collections U of T. Transcriptions are displayed publicly and indexed for search. It is possible to reuse Collections U of T objects in course content or transcribe-a-thons - but the resulting text from these should not be ingested into Collections U of T before review by collection owners. Content should be approved for public display and search indexing before being added to Collections U of T.

## From The Page

As example, the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library has purchased a From The Page membership account for their transcription work. The profile is available at https://fromthepage.com/utl

Other collection owners are encouraged to assess if From The Page meets their use case and context. From The Page offers trial accounts for testing.
