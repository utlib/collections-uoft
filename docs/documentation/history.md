# History of Collections U of T



[Collections U of T](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/) began as a project in the University of Toronto Libraries Information Technology Services department in 2013 in response to staff requests to make digitized special collections available online within a repository (presentation, search, preservation) ecosystem. The history of how the Collections U of T service evolved can be found in the _Introduction_ of ["Where Do We Go From Here: A Review of Technology Solutions for Providing Access to Digital Collections"](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000) in _Code4Lib Journal_ issue 47 from 2020.

This article was published by the ITS team in anticipation of [Islandora 7](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ISLANDORA/Start) / Drupal 7 end of support, which was originally scheduled for November 2021. In advance of this date, ITS initiated a technology review in 2019 to look at technology platform and infrastructure options to support the Collections U of T service, improve its efficiency and scalability, and also simplify its usability, maintenance, and workflows. 

Other internal migration goals for the service included:
* Enable end user ability to navigate and search _across_ U of T digitized special collections
* Improve end user's ability to quickly browse digitized images in any collection 
* Re-implement self-ingest for collection owners 
* Normalize metadata across collections
* Reduce Collections U of T maintenance hours for UTL ITS staff
* Simplify Collections U of T technology infrastructure (where possible: share infrastructure with other existing ITS, and Scholars Portal, services)
* Avoid replicating the web content creation/editing functionality available to staff through other web services
* Enhance search engine optimization (SEO) for digital collections
* Remain standards-based for relevant digital image and digitized special collections metadata standards
* Improve UTL public documentation of the standards used in Collections U of T and our local practices
* Incorporate web accessibility considerations into every design decision
* Remain flexible
* Consider [Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) principles](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/publishing-linked-open-usable-data/89234543) when relevant to service policy and infrastructure decisions. Note: though linked data functionality was explicitly out of scope for the migration project, it remains of interest for future. The indexing tool used by the New Collections U of T Platform, MarkLogic, is [linked data ready](https://www.progress.com/resources/papers/marklogic-semantics-whitepaper).
* Consider integration with external tools such as hosted transcriptions via From The Page or external IIIF manifests from the Internet Archive

The research process and migration pathway decision to move the service away from the Islandora platform is documented in the [2020 Code4Lib article](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000). However, Drupal 7 end of life was extended multiple times from 2020 to 2023. The final end of life date for Drupal 7 was finally communicated in June of 2023 - Drupal would reach its final end of support date on [January 5th of 2025](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2023-06-07). 

On May 21st, 2024, ITS soft launched its new homegrown New Collections U of T Platform comprised of "pluggable pieces" - a mix of new development alongside reusing existing UTL ITS technology infrastructure from other services as well as infrastructure provided by [Scholars Portal](https://ocul.on.ca/scholars-portal) - to deliver the Collections U of T service. The New Collections U of T Platform's infrastructure diagram is embedded below. It is also viewable in the UTL ITS [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM_vBtBc=/?share_link_id=757884216988).

The Islandora 7 multi-sites were redirected to the New Collections U of T Platform at the end of June 2024. All permalinks per digital object redirect to the New Platform. The old Islandora 7 multi-sites are each web archived on UTL's [Archive-It account](https://archive-it.org/collections/6473). The initial migration work is now complete, however, 2024 only marks the soft launch of New Collections U of T. ITS will continue to work on the Platform, gather staff and user feedback, and make iterative improvements, guided by our initial migration goals as well as the evolving requirements of service users and changes in technology. We are excited for this next phase of Collections U of T!

You can view the [2024 Migration Guide](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/2024-migration-guide) for more information about changes from Islandora 7 to the new homegrown Collections U of T Platform. You can also visit the Collections U of T [help pages](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/help) to learn how to search and reuse digital objects in new platform. 

If you have any questions, please email [Collections U of T support staff](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca). 

More details about the New Collections U of T Platform will be published on this page in the year ahead.
