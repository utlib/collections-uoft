# History of Collections U of T


Collections U of T began as a project in the University of Toronto Libraries Information Technology Services department in 2013 in response to staff requests to make digitized special collections available online within a repository (presentation, search, preservation) ecosystem. The history of how the Collections U of T service evolved can be found in the Introduction of ["Where Do We Go From Here: A Review of Technology Solutions for Providing Access to Digital Collections"](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000) in _Code4Lib Journal_ issue 47 (2020).

This article was published by the ITS team in anticipation of Islandora 7/Drupal 7 end of life, which was then anticipated for November 2020. In 2019, ITS initiated a technology review to look at technology platform and infrastructure options to support the Collections U of T service, improve its efficiency and scalability, and also simplify its usability, maintenance, and work flows. The research process and migration pathway decision to move away from Islandora is documented in our [2020 Code4Lib article](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000). As Drupal 7 end of life was extended periodically in 2020, the ITS team altered the Collections U of T migration timeline. The migration timeline was also impacted by other service priorities for UTL that arose out of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

With the final end of life date scheduled for Drupal 7 on [January 5th of 2025](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2023-06-07), UTL ITS finalized its migration plan and concluded the work to end support for the Collections U of T Islandora 7 multi-sites. On May 21st, 2024, ITS soft launched its new homegrown Collections U of T Platform comprised of "pluggable pieces" - reusing technology ingrastructure and design from other UTL ITS services and infrastructure provided by [Scholars Portal](https://ocul.on.ca/scholars-portal). 

The new Collections U of T Platform's infrastructure diagram is embedded below. It is also viewable in the UTL ITS [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM_vBtBc=/?share_link_id=757884216988).

The migration from Islandora to the New Collections U of T Platform included the following goals:
* ease end user ability to navigate and search _across_ U of T digitized special collections
* improve end user's ability to quickly browse digitized images in any collection 
* re-implement self ingest for collection owners
* normalize metadata across collections
* reduce Collections U of T maintenance hours for UTL ITS staff
* simplify Collections U of T technology infrastructure (where possible: share infrastructure with other existing ITS and Scholars Portal services)
* avoid replicating the web content creation/editing functionality of other services
 (for example: the Drupal web editing functionality of Islandora was replicated in library/archives Drupal websites, Exhibits U of T, and other UTL web services)
* enhance SEO for digital collections
* remain standards-based for relevant digital image and digitized special collections metadata standards
* improve UTL public documentation of the standards used in Collections U of T and our local practices
* incorporate web accessibility considerations into every design decision
* remain flexible
* consider Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) principles when relevant to infrastructure decisions. Note: though linked data functionality was explicity out of scope for the migration project, it remains a future consideration for the Collections U of T service. The indexing tool used by Collections U of T, MarkLogic, is [linked data ready](https://www.progress.com/resources/papers/marklogic-semantics-whitepaper).
* consider integration with external tools such as hosted transcriptions via From The Page

View the [2024 Migration Guide](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/2024-migration-guide) for more information about how the switch from Islandora 7 to the new homegrown Collections U of T Platform has changed the service. You can also visit the Collections U of T [help pages](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/help) to learn how to search and reuse items in new platform. If you have any questions, please email [Collections U of T support staff](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca). 

More details about the New Collections U of T Platform will be published on this page in the year ahead, as well as detailed credit to all of the amazing staff who have contributed so much time and work into the Collections U of T service for over a decade! Thank you all!
