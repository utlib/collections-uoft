# What is IIIF? (for staff)

> **DRAFT: further edits and instructions forthcoming.**

[IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)](http://iiif.io/) is a set of APIs and related tools created by an international community of leading cultural institutions. The IIIF community has created documentation to help you learn how to use the [IIIF APIs](https://iiif.io/get-started/how-iiif-works/), how to use the [IIIF Mirador viewer](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/#mirador), and how to [find other IIIF digitized collections](https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/) from cultural heritage institutions across the globe. 

**Public documentation about Collections U of T and IIIF is available at [https://collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/explore/getting_started](https://collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/explore/getting_started).**

Staff documentation about IIIF and Collections U of T is forthcoming.

## Using external IIIF services - Internet Archive

UTL makes use of the Internet Archive (IA) to publish digital collections. The IA is also [IIIF-enabled](https://github.com/internetarchive/iiif). Collectons owners may consider the following when deciding if they should use Collections U of T versus the Internet Archive:
* Collections U of T IIIF manifests and image URLs are published with the goal of providing access in perpetuity
* Metadata fields in Collections U of T IIIF are customizable according to the repository's specifications
* Collections U of T digital objects are published alongside all of UTL's other  digital collections within the UTL IIIF collection-level manifest

If your department would like more information or training about IIIF for your staff please [email us](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) to plan training sessions or support with IIIF / Collections U of T use for faculty and students after Summer 2025.
