# 2024 Collections U of T Migration Guide

It is with much excitement that the University of Toronto Libraries Information Technology Services announces the March 2024 beta launch of its new website for the Collections U of T service. This migration is the result of a multi-year project by ITS staff to move the Collections U of T service off of Islandora 7 (Drupal 7) as Drupal 7 reaches [end of support on January 5, 2025](https://www.drupal.org/about/drupal-7/d7eol/partners?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA_tuuBhAUEiwAvxkgTpcqWPPQRldzo2woWqXjQGdC9r5TTSbAuycGH45nlNF-2FpSv2Iv9xoCsB8QAvD_BwE).

**You can access the new Collections U of T beta website at [https://collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/](https://collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/).** 

Please note that the beta site is currently only available on U of T networks. For now, you must use VPN to access the beta site off campus. Remember that the site is available to you for testing purposes only at the moment - none of the -beta URLs are publicly accessible. Please do not share the -beta URLs with students, faculty, researchers, or the public.

Migration FAQ
--------

**1) Can I now resume ingesting new collections and images into the new Collections U of T beta site? Can I edit metadata again?**

_Yes - if you have an existing repository page in Collections U of T you can add new collections and items at any time. UTL ITS will support facilitated ingest throughout 2024 as we continue monitoring the performance of the new Collections U of T application. Please [email us](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) if you need ingest and editing support._

_The Collections U of T service is operating at reduced capacity until Summer 2025 due to ITS staffing._

**2) Is there an administrator login? How do I login to edit and upload digital images into the new Collections U of T beta site?**

_The administration login into new Collections U of T will be available in *2025*. UTL ITS is continuing to work on the Collections U of T administrator interface. 2024 will be devoted to monitoring new Collections U of T performance and indexing with support for facilitated ingests provided by ITS. The new Collections U of T administrator interface is expected to launch in the *Summer of 2025*._ 

**3) I never had a Collections U of T repository on Islandora. Can I add a new repository to the new Collections U of T website for my UTL library/archive?**

_Due to service capacity from July 1, 2024 to Summer 2025 we will not be adding new repositories into Collections U of T. Please [email us](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) in 2025 if you would like to begin using Collections U of T._

**4) When will the new Collections U of T website be available to the public (outside of U of T networks)?**    

_April 16, 2024._

_The [collections.library.utoronto.ca/*](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/) URL will point to the new Collections U of T website on April 16, 2024. This scheduled date may change if any issues arise on -beta._

**5) Should I still use the collections.library.utoronto.ca permalinks to collections and images?**

_Yes. The collections.library.utoronto.ca URL is still the correct permalink to collections and images. **Do not publicly promote or share the -beta URLs.** The collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca URL will be replaced with collections.library.utoronto.ca when the new Collections U of T website is publicly launched._

**6) When will my Islandora 7 website be taken offline?**

_Late Spring 2024 - we will communicate the exact date with collection owners as capacity allows (for both ITS and collection owners). Copies of the Islandora 7 sites will be captured in UTL's [Archive-It account](https://archive-it.org/collections/6473)._

**7) Will my Islandora site's page URLs be preserved?**

_No - but the ITS team has set up re-directs that will re-direct old Islandora URLs to the new Collections U of T website's URLs once the new site is publicly launched. Remember to continue to always use the **permalink URLs** when sharing collections and items with students, faculty, researchers and the public._

**8) Why did UTL migrate the Collections U of T service off of Islandora?**

_We selected a UTL-homegrown IIIF digital image collection discovery solution based on existing technology and infrastructure supported by UTL ITS and Scholars Portal. This homegrown solution is best suited to provide flexible and scaleable technology for the Collections U of T service and also leverages existing technology and staff expertise at UTL and Scholars Portal. You can read more about our research and planning around this migration in our [2020 Code4Lib article on the topic](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000)._
