# Adding & Editing Basic Pages

> **DRAFT: further edits and instructions forthcoming.**


Simple Pages or **Basic Pages** are the _about_ pages for your repository's digital collection - they are just HTML pages with about text or instructional text to supplement your digital collections and your metadata. You are not required to add Basic Pages for your digital collections but they are an option.

Collections U of T Basic Pages follow the URL pattern of _https://collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/explore/*_ where * is the page path for your repository's Basic Pages.

Basic Pages differ from your **/repository/** page. Your /repository/ page is your digital collection's homepage - it replaces every collection owner's Islandora Collections U of T website landing page. The /repository/ page is tied to Collections U of T digital object infrastructure so it is currently only edit-able by ITS. Email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) if you need to make a change to your /repository/ page.

Collections U of T currently uses the Omeka platform to enable you to add Basic Pages. Please note that this Omeka instance is a separate application from the rest of the Collections U of T platform and **only** serves the function of providing a web user interface for you to add and edit Basic Pages for your collection. Do not store any digital object image or metadata content in Omeka. 

Email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) to request a login account to edit your Collections U of T Basic Pages in the Omeka /explore/ instance.

Each top-level repository has the option to use its own "Exhibit" in Omeka where you can add and edit Basic Pages with instruction, highlights, and other information relevant to your Collections U of T content - this is your space to share "about" content with your end users. Aside from the Basic Pages functionality, no other Omeka features are enabled. You can only add or edit the Basic Pages in your repository's designated Omeka Exhibit. You cannot add Items, Simple Pages, or Tags. In some cases you may want to add non-Collections U of T instructional or decorative images to your pages - you will need to email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) for assistance with this. 

Omeka was selected as the Basic Pages solution for the New Collections U of T Platform for practical reasons since evaluating web content tools and services within ITS is ongoing. Omeka offers a simple method for creating Basic Pages in New Collections U of T that most staff are already familiar with. The Basic Pages work flow in New Collections may change in the future. For now, please use the Omeka /explore/ instance if you need to create "About" pages for your collections and consult with ITS if you have any questions or feedback.

Follow the instructions below to learn how to add a page to your existing simple pages as well as edit the page, add a IIIF embed, add responsive images, and add a link gallery. If you need to adjust the sidebar menu on your /repository/ page in Collections U of T after editing your pages you will need to email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca).
