# Adding & Editing Basic Pages

## About /explore/ Basic Pages
Simple Pages or **Basic Pages** are the _about_ pages for your repository's digital collections. These are just HTML pages with any about text or instructional text to supplement your digital collections and your metadata in Collections U of T. You are not required to add Basic Pages for your digital collections but they are an option available to each repository. 

Collections U of T currently uses the Omeka platform to enable you to add Basic Pages. Please note that this Omeka instance is a separate application from the rest of the Collections U of T platform and **only** serves the function of providing a web user interface for you to add and edit Basic Pages for your collection. 

{: .note }
> Do not store any digital collections image or metadata content in the Omeka /explore/ instance. 

Your Basic Pages can be found at the URL pattern of _https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/*_ where * is the page path for your repository's Basic Pages. For example:
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/fisher](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/fisher)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/utarms-online](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/utarms-online)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/mdl](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/mdl)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/musiclibrary](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/musiclibrary)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/rclc-hkl](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/rclc-hkl)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/usmc](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/usmc)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/usmc-archives](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/usmc-archives)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/kcha](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/kcha)
  

You can also make a single /explore/ Exhibit if you'd like to create information about a specific collection, such as: 
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/anatomia](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/anatomia) (Fisher)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/broadsides](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/broadsides) (Fisher)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/chamberlin](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/chamberlin) (Fisher)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/cpp](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/cpp) (Fisher)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/insulin](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/insulin) (Fisher)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/heritage](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/heritage)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/hollar](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/hollar) (Fisher)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/patent](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/patent) (Fisher)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/utarms-ohcsa/home](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/utarms-ohcsa/home) (UTARMS)

> Email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) to request a login account to edit your Basic Pages in the Omeka /explore/ instance. You will need a login if you want to modify any content with /explore/ in the URL. Your login will enable you to edit and create [Omeka Exhibits](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/#getting-started) and [Basic Pages](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/ExhibitBuilder/#pages) within an Exhibit. You will not have permission to delete any Exhibit that is not your own. You will have permission to delete pages in your own Exhibits - please avoid accidentally deleting a page. The Omeka /explore/ permissions are managed through the [Omeka Course Tools Plugin](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/CourseTools/). Let [ITS](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) know if you have any permissions questions. 

Basic Pages in the /explore/ Omeka instance are **different** from your **/repository/** page. Your /repository/ page is your digital collection's **homepage** - it replaces every collection owner's former Islandora website. The /repository/ pages are currently only edit-able by ITS. Email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) if you need to make a change to your /repository/ page. If you need to adjust the sidebar menu on your /repository/ page in Collections U of T after editing your /explore/ pages you will need to email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca). 

None of the Omeka /explore/ page URLs can be expected to be persistent. If you want to link to a collection, use the Collections U of T permalink URL patter of _https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/*PID*_ where *PID* is the identifier of the collection. For example:
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/fisher:root](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/fisher:root)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/mdl:root](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/mdl:root)
* [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/rclc-hkl:root](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/rclc-hkl:root) and so on.

Each top-level repository can choose how you want to use the /explore/ Basic Pages. This is your space to share "about" content with your end users. Aside from the Basic Pages functionality, no other Omeka features are enabled. Your logins are set up to add or edit Basic Pages in your repository's designated Omeka Exhibit. You cannot add Items, Simple Pages, or Tags. In some cases you may want to add non-Collections U of T instructional or decorative images to your pages - you will need to email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) for assistance with this. 

## About the /explore/ Omeka Classic tool

Omeka was selected as the Basic Pages solution for the New Collections U of T Platform because Omeka offers a simple method for creating Basic Pages. Most staff are already familiar Omeka. The Basic Pages work flow in New Collections may change in the future. For now, please use the Omeka /explore/ instance if you need to create "About" pages for your collections and consult with ITS if you have any questions or feedback.

Follow the instructions below to learn how to use the /explore/ Omeka instance for building your Basic Pages.

{: .note }
> You may also find it helpful to review the [official Omeka Classic documentation](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/) before using /explore/. Just remember that the /explore/ Omeka instance is only intended to making Basic Pages - it is not for creating digital collections.

## IIIF in the /explore/ instance

The /explore/ Omeka instance has a number of IIIF features enabled to connect your IIIF Collections U of T digital objects with any Basic Pages you create. This includes: 
*  [Collections U of T IIIF Embed](https://scribehow.com/shared/Add_and_edit_a_basic_page_for_your_collection__mGEb-jYgTAKCUGsj2ixvxQ#2012cb1e)
*  [Link Gallery and Link Carousel](https://scribehow.com/shared/Add_and_edit_a_basic_page_for_your_collection__mGEb-jYgTAKCUGsj2ixvxQ#ef14f5a7) - use these blocks instead of the Gallery and Carousel blocks
*  [Responsive Images](https://scribehow.com/shared/Add_and_edit_a_basic_page_for_your_collection__mGEb-jYgTAKCUGsj2ixvxQ#efc29b26)
*  [Meta Redirects](https://scribehow.com/shared/Add_and_edit_a_basic_page_for_your_collection__mGEb-jYgTAKCUGsj2ixvxQ#d2de0f0e)

{: .note }
> Caution: consider usability when building your Basic Pages and adding IIIF images onto your page. ITS recommends that you do not exceed more than 15 IIIF embeds on one page. Do not add excessive pages. Always test your Exhibit on mobile any time you edit a Basic Page.
