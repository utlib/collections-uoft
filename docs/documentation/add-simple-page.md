# Adding & editing basic pages in Collections U of T

> **DRAFT: further edits and instructions forthcoming.**


Collections U of T currently uses the Omeka platform to enable you to add basic pages about your Collections U of T repository and its collections. Please note that this Omeka instance is a separate application from the rest of the Collections U of T platform and **only** serves the function of providing a web user interface for you to add and edit basic pages for your collection. 

Email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) to request a login account to edit your Collections U of T Basic Pages. 

Each top-level repository has its own "Exhibit" in Omeka where you can add and edit basic pages with instruction, highlights, and other information relevant to your Collections U of T content - this is your space to share "about" content with your end users. Aside from the basic pages functionality, no other Omeka features are enabled. You can only add or edit the basic pages in your repository's designated Omeka Exhibit. You cannot add Items, Simple Pages, or Tags. In some cases you may want to add non-Collections U of T instructional or decorative images to your pages - you will need to email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) for assistance with this.

Follow the instructions below to learn how to add a page to your existing simple pages as well as edit the page, add a IIIF embed, add responsive images, and add a link gallery. If you need to adjust the sidebar menu on your /repository/ page in Collections U of T after editing your pages you will need to email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca). The /repository/ page in Collections U of T is only edit-able by ITS.
