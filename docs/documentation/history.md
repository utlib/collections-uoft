# History of Collections U of T

Collections U of T began as a project in the University of Toronto Libraries Information Technology Services department in 2013 in response to staff requests to make digitized special collections available online within a repository (presentation, search, preservation) ecosystem. Islandora was chosen as the platform and set up in a multi-site structure (one Fedora 3 back end with multiple Drupal 7 front ends). As years have passed, the context for the Collections U of T service has shifted. UTL preservation services and work flows were developed through Project Canopus. Collections U of T no longer provides preservation functionality. In 2016, IIIF capacity was integrated into the service and Mirador was implemented as a IIIF-enabled viewer for digital objects. 

In anticipation of Islandora 7/Drupal 7 end of life, ITS conducted a technology review to look at technology platform and infrastructure options to support the Collections U of T service, improve its efficiency and scalability, and also simplify its usability, maintenance, and work flows. ITS staff wrote about this research process and migration pathway decision in a [2020 Code4Lib article](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000).

In Spring 2024, UTL ITS is soft launching its new homegrown Collections U of T Platform. More details about this platform will be published soon, as well as credit to the staff who have contributed so much time and work into the Collections U of T service.
