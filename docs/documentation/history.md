# History of Collections U of T



Collections U of T began as a project in the University of Toronto Libraries Information Technology Services department in 2013 in response to staff requests to make digitized special collections available online within a repository (presentation, search, preservation) ecosystem. The history of how the Collections U of T service evolved can be found in the _Introduction_ of ["Where Do We Go From Here: A Review of Technology Solutions for Providing Access to Digital Collections"](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000) in _Code4Lib Journal_ issue 47 from 2020.

This article was published by the ITS team in anticipation of Islandora 7/Drupal 7 end of support, which was  originally scheduled for November 2021. In advance of this date, ITS initiated a technology review in 2019 to look at technology platform and infrastructure options to support the Collections U of T service, improve its efficiency and scalability, and also simplify its usability, maintenance, and work flows. 

Other internal migration goals for the service included:
* enable end user ability to navigate and search _across_ U of T digitized special collections
* improve end user's ability to quickly browse digitized images in any collection 
* re-implement self ingest for collection owners 
* normalize metadata across collections
* reduce Collections U of T maintenance hours for UTL ITS staff
* simplify Collections U of T technology infrastructure (where possible: share infrastructure with other existing ITS, and Scholars Portal, services)
* avoid replicating the web content creation/editing functionality available to staff through other web services
* enhance SEO for digital collections
* remain standards-based for relevant digital image and digitized special collections metadata standards
* improve UTL public documentation of the standards used in Collections U of T and our local practices
* incorporate web accessibility considerations into every design decision
* remain flexible
* consider Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) principles when relevant to infrastructure decisions. Note: though linked data functionality was explicity out of scope for the migration project, it remains a future priority. The indexing tool used by Collections U of T, MarkLogic, is [linked data ready](https://www.progress.com/resources/papers/marklogic-semantics-whitepaper).
* consider integration with external tools such as hosted transcriptions via From The Page

The research process and migration pathway decision to move the service away from Islandora is documented in the [2020 Code4Lib article](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000). However, Drupal 7 end of life was extended multiples times from 2020 to 2023. The final end of life date for Drupal 7 was finally communicated in June of 2023 - Drupal would reach its final end of support date on [January 5th of 2025](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2023-06-07). 

On May 21st, 2024, ITS soft launched its new homegrown New Collections U of T Platform comprised of "pluggable pieces" - reusing technology ingrastructure and design from other UTL ITS services as well as infrastructure provided by [Scholars Portal](https://ocul.on.ca/scholars-portal) - to deliver the Collections U of T service. The New Collections U of T Platform's infrastructure diagram is embedded below. It is also viewable in the UTL ITS [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM_vBtBc=/?share_link_id=757884216988).

The Islandora 7 multi-sites were redirected to the New Collections U of T Platform at the end of June 2024. All permalinks per digital object redirect to the New Platform. The initial migration work is now complete but 2024 only marks the soft launch of New Collections. ITS will continue to work on the Platform and gather staff and user feedback while also making iterative improvements, guided by our initial migration goals.

You can view the [2024 Migration Guide](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/2024-migration-guide) for more information about changes from Islandora 7 to the new homegrown Collections U of T Platform. You can also visit the Collections U of T [help pages](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/help) to learn how to search and reuse digital objects in new platform. 

If you have any questions, please email [Collections U of T support staff](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca). 

More details about the New Collections U of T Platform will be published on this page in the year ahead, as well as detailed credit to all of the amazing staff who have contributed so much time and work into the Collections U of T service for over a decade! Thank you all!
