# History of Collections U of T

> **DRAFT: further edits forthcoming.**


Collections U of T began as a project in the University of Toronto Libraries Information Technology Services department in 2013 in response to staff requests to make digitized special collections available online within a repository (presentation, search, preservation) ecosystem. Islandora was chosen as the platform and set up in a multi-site structure (one Fedora 3 back end with multiple Drupal 7 front ends). As years have passed, the context for the Collections U of T service has shifted. UTL preservation services and work flows were developed through Project Canopus. Collections U of T no longer provides preservation functionality. In 2016, IIIF functionality was integrated into the service and Mirador was implemented as a IIIF-enabled viewer for digital objects. 

In anticipation of Islandora 7/Drupal 7 end of life, ITS initiated a technology review in 2019 to look at technology platform and infrastructure options to support the Collections U of T service, improve its efficiency and scalability, and also simplify its usability, maintenance, and work flows. ITS staff wrote about this research process and migration pathway decision in a [2020 Code4Lib article](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000). As Drupal 7 end of life was extended periodically over the last five years the ITS team altered the Collections U of T migration timeline. The migration timeline was also impacted by other service priorities arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

With the final end of life coming for Drupal 7 in January 2025, UTL ITS has reached the end of support for its Islandora 7 Collections U of T sites. We are now soft launching a new homegrown Collections U of T Platform. 

The migration from Islandora to the New Collections U of T Platform included the following goals:
* ease end user ability to navigate and search _across_ U of T digitized special collections
* improve end user's ability to quickly browse digitized images in any collection 
* re-implement self ingest for collection owners
* normalize metadata across collections
* reduce Collections U of T maintenance hours for UTL ITS staff
* simplify Collections U of T technology infrastructure (where possible: share infrastructure with other existing ITS and Scholars Portal services)
* avoid replicating the web content creation/editing functionality of other services
 (for example: Drupal web editing functionality of Islandora is replicated in library/archives Drupal websites, Exhibits U of T, and other web services)
* enhance SEO
* remain standards-based for relevant digital image and digitized special collections metadata standards
* improve UTL public documentation of the standards used in Collections U of T and our local practices
* incorporate web accessibility considerations into every design decision
* remain flexible
* consider Linked Open Usable Data (LOUD) principles when relevant though linked data functionality was explicity out of scope for the migration
* consider integration with external tools such as hosted transcriptions via From The Page

More details about the New Collections U of T Platform will be published soon, as well as credit to all of the amazing staff who have contributed so much time and work into the Collections U of T service over the last decade!
