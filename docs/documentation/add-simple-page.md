# Adding & Editing Basic Pages

> **DRAFT: further edits and instructions forthcoming.**


Collections U of T currently uses the Omeka platform to enable you to add Basic Pages about your Collections U of T repository and its collections. Basic Pages are just HTML pages with about or instructional text to supplement your digital collections. Please note that this Omeka instance is a separate application from the rest of the Collections U of T platform and **only** serves the function of providing a web user interface for you to add and edit basic pages for your collection. Do not store any digital object image or metadata content in Omeka. 

Email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) to request a login account to edit your Collections U of T Basic Pages in the Omeka /explore/ instance.

Each top-level repository has its own "Exhibit" in Omeka where you can add and edit basic pages with instruction, highlights, and other information relevant to your Collections U of T content - this is your space to share "about" content with your end users. Aside from the basic pages functionality, no other Omeka features are enabled. You can only add or edit the basic pages in your repository's designated Omeka Exhibit. You cannot add Items, Simple Pages, or Tags. In some cases you may want to add non-Collections U of T instructional or decorative images to your pages - you will need to email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) for assistance with this. 

Omeka was selected as the Basic Pages solution for the New Collections U of T Platform for practical reasons. Evaluating web content tools and services within ITS is ongoing. Omeka offers a simple method for creating Basic Pages in New Collections U of T that most staff are already familiar with. The Basic Pages work flow in New Collections may change in the future. For now, please use the Omeka /explore/ instance if you need to create "About" pages for your collections and consult with ITS if you have any questions or feedback.

Follow the instructions below to learn how to add a page to your existing simple pages as well as edit the page, add a IIIF embed, add responsive images, and add a link gallery. If you need to adjust the sidebar menu on your /repository/ page in Collections U of T after editing your pages you will need to email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca). The /repository/ page in Collections U of T is only edit-able by ITS.
