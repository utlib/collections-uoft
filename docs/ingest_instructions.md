# Ingest instructions

New Collections U of T infrastructure will be launched in 2023 as the UTL ITS team completes its migration off of Islandora 7 (Drupal 7). 

Manual ingests by UTL ITS are possible during this migration period. 

Please clear all copyright, privacy, and rights considerations for the collection before submitting the images to Collections U of T for online public access.

To ingest into an existing top-level collection, [contact us](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) with the following details:

**If creating a new collection, include:**
1. Title of the collection
2. Brief description to the collection (to be included in the collection's metadata description)
3. PID of collection
4. Related catalog record catkey, permalink, or any “Part of” links - i.e. corresponding Discover Archives finding aid or link to external collection website
5. Call number
6. Path to the completed [metadata spreadsheet](https://github.com/utlib/collections-uoft/blob/main/docs/metadata_template_instructions.md)
7. Path to the directory where the images are stored (you must ensure image filenames match metadata spreadsheet filenames)
8. Deadline for ingest to help us prioritize and schedule the work

**If adding to an existing collection, include:**
1. PID of the collection you are adding to
2. Path to the completed [metadata spreadsheet](https://github.com/utlib/collections-uoft/blob/main/docs/metadata_template_instructions.md) or URL paths to existing Alma MARC records (we can convert these to spreadsheet using MARCEdit)
3. Whether the viewing direction of the images should be right to left
4. Path to the directory where the images are stored (you must ensure image filenames match metadata spreadsheet filenames)
5. Deadline for ingest to help us prioritize and schedule the work

Consult with the Collections U of T team if you are ingesting OCR text or transcriptions for your image files. Instructions for using transcription tools with Collections U of T IIIF manifests can also be found [here](/main/docs/transcription_and_annotation_tools.md).

**A note on updating images within an object that has already been public for an extended period of time**

Remember that Collections U of T publishes images as data - this data is provided as a [IIIF Manifest](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/). If you update an image in your digital object, the IIIF Manifest is *also* altered. This may cause an issue for end users because they may have relied on the original images that you published to create an annotation or other research output from the IIIF Manifest. 

Be aware that changing the images in your digital objects after they have been published for an extended period of time may impact a user's research output. Please update images after you have published them with extreme caution - try to only publish digital objects once you are certain of the final image files that you want to use. 

**This page will be updated with self-ingest instructions when the new Collections U of T infrastructure is launched.**
