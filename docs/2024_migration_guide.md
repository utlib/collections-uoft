# 2024 Collections U of T Migration Guide

It is with much excitement that the University of Toronto Libraries Information Technology Services announces the March 2024 beta launch of its new website for the Collections U of T service. This migration is the result of a multi-year project by ITS staff to move the Collections U of T service off of Islandora 7 (Drupal 7) as Drupal 7 reaches [end of support on January 5, 2025](https://www.drupal.org/about/drupal-7/d7eol/partners?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA_tuuBhAUEiwAvxkgTpcqWPPQRldzo2woWqXjQGdC9r5TTSbAuycGH45nlNF-2FpSv2Iv9xoCsB8QAvD_BwE).

**You can access the new Collections U of T beta website at [https://collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/](https://collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/).** 

Please note that the beta site is currently only available on U of T networks. For now, you must use VPN to access the beta site off campus. Remember that the site is available to you for testing purposes only at the moment - none of the -beta URLs are publicly accessible. Please do not share the -beta URLs with students, faculty, researchers, or the public.

Migration FAQ
--------

**1) Can I now resume ingesting new collections and images into the new Collections U of T beta site? Can I edit metadata again?**

_Yes - if you have an existing repository page in Collections U of T you can add new collections and items at any time. UTL ITS will support facilitated ingest throughout 2024 as we continue monitoring the performance of the new Collections U of T application. Please [email us](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) if you need ingest and editing support._

**2) Is there an administrator login? How do I login to edit and upload digital images into the new Collections U of T beta site?**

_You cannot login to the new Collections U of T application *yet*. UTL ITS is continuing to work on the Collections U of T administrator interface as we spend 2024 monitoring new Collections U of T performance and indexing. The new Collections U of T administrator interface is expected to launch in the *Summer of 2025*._ 

**3) I never had a repository on Islandora. Can I add a new repository to the new Collections U of T website for my UTL library/archive?**

_We will begin onboarding new repositories to the new Collections U of T website in Summer 2025 due to service capacity from July 1, 2024 to July 1, 2025._

**4) When will the new Collections U of T website be available to the public (outside of U of T networks)?**    

_Late Spring 2024 - we will communicate the exact date._

**5) Should I still use the collections.library.utoronto.ca permalinks to collections and images?**

_Yes. The collections.library.utoronto.ca URL is still the correct permalink to collections and images. Do not use -beta URLs. The collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/ URL will be replaced with collections.library.utoronto.ca when the new Collections U of T website is publicly launched in late Spring 2024._

**6) When will my Islandora 7 website be taken offline?**

_Late Spring 2024 - we will communicate the exact date. Copies of the Islandora 7 sites will be captured in UTL's [Archive-It account](https://archive-it.org/collections/6473)._

**7) Will my Islandora site's page URLs be preserved?**

_No - but the ITS team has set up re-directs that will re-direct old Islandora URLs to the new Collections U of T website's URLs once the new site is publicly launched. Remember to continue to always use the **permalink URLs** when sharing collections and items with students, faculty, researchers and the public._

**8) Why did UTL migrate the Collections U of T service off of Islandora?**

_We decided to create a custom IIIF digital image collection discovery platform based on existing technology and infrastructure supported by UTL ITS and Scholars Portal. This solution is best suited to provide flexible and scaleable technology for the Collections U of T service. You can read more about our research and planning around this migration in our [2020 Code4Lib article on the topic](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000)._
