# Adding and editing basic pages in Collections U of T

Collections U of T currently uses the Omeka platform to enable you to add basic pages about your Collections U of T repository and its collections. 

Each top-level repository has its own "Exhibit" in Omeka where you can add and edit basic pages with instruction, highlights, and other information relevant to your Collections U of T content that you want to share with your end users. Please note that no other Omeka features are enabled aside from building Basic Pages in your repository's designated Omeka Exhibit. This version of Omeka does not allow you to add Items, Simple Pages, or Tags. It is intended only for adding Basic Pages.

Email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) to request a login account to edit your Collections U of T Basic Pages. 

Follow the instructions below to learn how to add a page to your existing simple pages as well as edit the page, add a IIIF embed, add responsive images, and add a link gallery. If you need to adjust the sidebar menu on your /repository/ page in Collections U of T after editing your pages you will need to email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca). The /repository/ page in Collections U of T is only edit-able by ITS.
