**This guide provides UTL staff with instructions and FAQs about the Collections U of T migration from Islandora 7 to the new UTL-homegrown "New Collections Platform" in Spring 2024.**


It is with much excitement that the University of Toronto Libraries Information Technology Services announces the May 2024 soft launch of the New Collections U of T Platform for the Collections U of T Service. This migration is the result of a multi-year project by ITS staff to move the Collections U of T Service off of Islandora 7 (Drupal 7) as Drupal 7 reaches [end of support on January 5, 2025](https://www.drupal.org/about/drupal-7/d7eol/partners?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA_tuuBhAUEiwAvxkgTpcqWPPQRldzo2woWqXjQGdC9r5TTSbAuycGH45nlNF-2FpSv2Iv9xoCsB8QAvD_BwE).

> **The New Collections U of T Platform was publicly soft launched on May 21st, 2024. You can access Collections U of T at [https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/).**

# Migration FAQ for UTL staff
--------

**1) Can my department resume ingesting new collections and images into the New Collections U of T Platform?**

_Yes, if you have an existing repository record in Collections U of T you can add new collections and items at any time after May 21st, 2024. UTL ITS will support facilitated ingest throughout 2024 as we continue monitoring the performance of the New Collections U of T Platform. Please [email ITS](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) if you need ingest and editing support. Facilitated ingest instructions can be found on the [Ingest Instructions](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/ingest-instructions) page._

_Please consider that the Collections U of T Service will be operating at reduced capacity from July 2024 until Summer 2025 due to ITS staffing._

**2) Can I edit metadata again?**

_Yes but you need to [email ITS](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) for support until the New Collections U of T administrator interface is complete. Let us know what you need help editing and we will pass along instructions._

**3) Is there an administrator login for me to login to the New Collections Platform to edit and upload digital images into the new Collections U of T beta site?**

_Not yet - see above. The administration login into New Collections U of T will be available later in 2025. UTL ITS is continuing to work on the Collections U of T administrator interface. 2024 will be devoted to monitoring new Collections U of T ingest, performance, and indexing. ITS will support collection owners with facilitated ingests until development on the administrator interface is completed. The new Collections U of T administrator interface is expected to be rolled out in late 2025._ 

**4) Is there an administrator login for me to login to the New Collections Platform to edit and add Basic Pages?**

_Yes. See [Editing Basic Pages](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/add-simple-page) instructions. [Email ITS](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) for a login._ 

**5) I never had a Collections U of T repository on Islandora. Can I add a new repository to the New Collections U of T Platform for my UTL library/archive?**

_Due to service capacity from July 1, 2024 to Summer 2025 we will not be adding any new repositories into New Collections U of T. You can [email us](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) to [request a new repository](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/adding-new-collections) be added and we will review these requests and onboard new repositories in Fall 2025 for you to begin using the Collections U of T service._

**6) What are the Collections U of T permalinks to collections and images?**

_The `collections.library.utoronto.ca/view/PID` URL is still the correct permalink to use when referencing collections and images._

**8) When will Islandora 7 websites be taken offline?**

_By end June 2024 - copies of the Islandora 7 sites are captured in UTL's [Archive-It account](https://archive-it.org/collections/6473)._

**9) Will my Islandora site's page URLs be preserved in New Collections?**

_No - but the ITS team has set up re-directs that will re-direct old Islandora URLs to the appropriate new Collections U of T website's URLs, per collection. Remember to continue to always use the **permalink URLs** when sharing collections and items with students, faculty, researchers, and the public._

**10) Why did UTL migrate the Collections U of T service off of Islandora?**

_We selected a UTL-homegrown IIIF digital image collection discovery solution based on existing technology and infrastructure supported by UTL ITS and Scholars Portal. This homegrown solution is best suited to provide flexible and scaleable technology for the Collections U of T service. It also leverages existing technology and staff expertise at UTL and Scholars Portal. You can read more about our research and planning around this migration in our [2020 Code4Lib article on the topic](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/15000). Additional information about the New Collections platform will published in the year ahead._
