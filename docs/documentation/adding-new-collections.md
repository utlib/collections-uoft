# Requesting a new top-level repository in Collections U of T

## What is a repository?

In Collections U of T, the libraries or archives who care for the physical items and their digitized surrogates are called "repositories" ([view current repositories](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/repositories)). Within the Collections U of T database, each participating repository gets a top-level repository collection that acts as the top-level collection container for all of the repository's digital objects. You must submit a request for a new top-level repository before you can add digital collections to Collections U of T.

## Before requesting a Collections U of T repository...

Review the [service parameters](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/#about-collections-u-of-t) to make sure Collections U of T fits your needs.

## How to request a Collections U of T repository...

{: .note }
> ***Please note from July 2024 to Summer 2025 the Collections U of T service will be operating in maintenance mode with reduced staff capacity. You can still submit a request for a new repository but the service will not be adding and onboarding new repositories until Fall 2025.***


Email [digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) with the following information:

* Title of the new top-level collection (usually the name of the library/archives)
* Brief description for the collection (this will display publicly on the top-level collection page)
* PID of collection (this will be included in the URL for your top-level collection and *cannot* be changed once it is published)
* Approximate size (MB, GB, or TB) of images you are initially planning to ingest (we may need to increase storage, depending on your collection size)
* Emails for staff who will require access to the Collections U of T administration back end

You must also confirm that the image collection(s) you are ingesting are:
* intended for long-term, public, and perpetual acess
* cleared for accessibility, privacy, and copyright considerations. You must follow Canadian Copyright law when uploading digital images into Collections U of T. If you do not hold the rights to publish the material online, permission must be obtained and shared with Collections U of T service staff.
* not duplicates of existing items already in Collections U of T under another library/archives' collection
* not being stored in Collections U of T for preservation (Collections U of T is not a preservation repository)

**Note: because of service capacity, approving your request, onboarding staff, and setting up your new collection may take 2-8 weeks to complete depending on the request.**

To have your request for a new top-level collection in Collections U of T approved, please ensure:
* You have time available to meet with a Collections U of T service representative to talk through policies and training.
* You are able to commit to following Collections U of T policies and procedures, both existing policies and with an understanding that service policies may evolve. If you cannot follow Collections U of T policies and procedures, your collection may be taken offline.
* Staff working on the collection are familiar with metadata best practices and can follow Collections U of T metadata guidelines. If you cannot follow Collections U of T metadata guidelines, your collection may be taken offline.
* You have staffing capacity to support the care and maintenance of the digital collection over time. Note: Collections U of T service staff will not have capacity to maintain your collections or web content. If you do not maintain your content ingested into Collections U of T, it may be taken offline.
* You commit to joining the [Collections U of T Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a0c2caaac27a04fe7b6e37018970a66b5%40thread.tacv2/Collections%2520U%2520of%2520T?groupId=2151c2c7-2063-412d-8ebf-de2c9f809003&tenantId=78aac226-2f03-4b4d-9037-b46d56c55210) to follow service updates (Teams channel launched in March 2024).
