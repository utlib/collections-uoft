# What is IIIF? (for staff)

[IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework)](http://iiif.io/) is a set of APIs and related tools created by an international community of leading cultural institutions. The IIIF community has created documentation to help you learn how to use the [IIIF APIs](https://iiif.io/get-started/how-iiif-works/), how to use the [IIIF Mirador viewer](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/#mirador), and how to [find other IIIF digitized collections](https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/) from cultural heritage institutions across the globe. 

**Public documentation about Collections U of T and IIIF is available at [https://collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/explore/getting_started](https://collections-beta.library.utoronto.ca/explore/getting_started).**

Staff documentation about IIIF and Collections U of T is forthcoming - including when to consider using Collections U of T for IIIF versus the Internet Archive (the IA is also [IIIF-enabled](https://github.com/internetarchive/iiif)). 

If your department would like more information or training about IIIF for your staff please [email us](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca) to plan training sessions or support with IIIF / Collections U of T use for faculty and students after Summer 2025.
