> ***The New Collections U of T Platform launched in May 2024. Go to the [2024 Migration Guide](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/2024-migration-guide) for more information. From July 2025 to April 2026 the New Collections U of T Platform will undergo its next phase of development to create and launch an administrator user interface ("admin UI"). The admin UI will enable collection owners to modify and ingest content independently (without ITS support). Until the admin UI is launched, collection owners can contact ITS for support to modify or ingest collections. More details and timelines about the admin UI will be available after December 2025.***

## About Collections U of T
[Collections U of T](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca) is the  University of Toronto Libraries' image repository for digitized special collections and archives. The service supports UTL special collections and archives staff in providing open access to digitized special collections and archives through the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/) and standard metadata formats. 

Collections U of T provides U of T staff:

1. Collection management and a public discovery interface for university special collections and archives digital image collections
2. Indexing for digital object metadata
3. Search and discovery for collections and digital objects
4. User management and authentication (CRUD for collections and digital objects)
5. Statistics for collections and digital objects
6. The ability to create "simple pages" for content _about_ collections and items stored in Collections U of T

Collections U of T is *not*:
* A digitization service
* A digital exhibit service
* A digital preservation service
* Able to store media types other than _image files_. Collections U of T does not currently support .pdf, audio, or video collections
* Open to anyone for use - digital collections must be *assessed* prior to inclusion in Collections U of T. Because the service is intended for providing long term discovery and access for digital image collections, the digital objects must belong to a UTL department or archives for long term care and maintenance purposes. Collections from external organizations must be assessed by a UTL department and acquired via formal agreement with the external organization prior to inclusion in Collections U of T. Collections U of T is not intended for hosting digitized content from external institutions. Note that UTL collection owners are responsible for assessing digital objects for accessibility, privacy and copyright considerations, as well as staffing capacity to support the care and maintenance of the digital collection over time. 

### Collections U of T Policies

#### Collection Guidelines

1. Digital collections or digital objects deposited into Collections U of T are published with the intent of access in perpetuity. All content ingested into Collections U of T will be public. Collections U of T does not currently have any collection or item restriction features - all images in the repository are publicly accessible and publicly downloadable. If you require storage for digital image collections but need to restrict access or downloads to internal UTL or U of T users, please [contact us](mailto:digitalinitiatives@library.utoronto.ca). 
2. The repository is structured by top-level U of T library or archives. Any content added to Collections U of T *must* belong to a top-level collection reflecting the UTL library or archives department responsible for the long term maintenance of the digitized items and collections. The top-level collection library or archives is referred to as the "collection owner".
3. To create a new top-level collection and obtain logins, U of T library or archives staff can [request a new repository](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/adding-new-collections) in Collections U of T. 
4. Collection owners are responsible for reading and following Collections U of T policies.
5. Collections and items deposited into Collections U of T must not be ephemeral or intended for temporary access.
6. Collection owners must not deposit duplicates of the same item.
7. Collection owners must follow Canadian Copyright law when submitting items/collections to Collections U of T. If the collection owner does not hold the rights to publish the material online, permission must be obtained. Contact the UTL [Scholarly Communications and Copyright Office](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/copyright/scholarly-communications-and-copyright-office) if you need support. 
8. Collection owners are responsible for assessing digital objects for accessibility, privacy, and copyright considerations, in addition to any emerging data care principles. Items submitted to Collections U of T will be accessible in perpetuity. This means digital objects and related data may require future staff time to maintain over time. Both current and future staffing capacity to support the care and maintenance of the digital collection should be assessed prior to publishing data in Collections U of T. As of Fall 2025, collection owners can consult the [U of T Information Security resources Sharepoint](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/its-isea-StrategicInitiatives/Strategy/SitePages/Risk-Management.aspx?xsdata=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&sdata=blBSR0VGS3pvQ09RVXo3YTlvZ0hZeTR1SVV5L003UG5sdkx5cTZGekhDOD0=&ovuser=78aac226-2f03-4b4d-9037-b46d56c55210,kelli.babcock@utoronto.ca&OR=Teams-HL&CT=1760539711485&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIxNDE1LzI1MDkxMTE2MDE4In0=) to access resources and consider relevant information security risks prior to publishing digital collections.

## What is Collections U of T IIIF?

IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is a set of APIs and related tools created by an international community of leading cultural institutions. The IIIF community has created [a guide](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/) to help you get started in learning about IIIF and how to make use of it.

Our ["What is IIIF?"](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/iiif-collections) page also includes IIIF documentation specific to Collections U of T for staff and the [Reusing Collections U of T Items with IIIF](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/explore/faq/getting_started) help page has instructions for users.  

## Metadata and Data Model

The full Collections U of T data model is available upon request.

Generally, digital objects are structured as follow:
* [Repositories](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/repositories) have
  * [Collections](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/search?itemType=COLLECTION) have
    * ["Book"](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/search?itemType=BOOK) items have
      * ["Page"](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/search?itemType=PAGE) items
    * ["Image"](https://collections.library.utoronto.ca/search?itemType=IMAGE) items
  * [Basic pages](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/add-simple-page)  
   

## Descriptive Metadata Standards
Historically, Collections U of T has used [MODS](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/generalapp.html)-based descriptive metadata formatted as spreadsheets and then converted to [xml](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp ), or MARC converted to MODS xml via [MarcEdit](https://marcedit.reeset.net/). Descriptive metadata is also converted to JSON in Collections U of T IIIF manifests for display purposes. As of 2024, Collections U of T now uses a spreadsheet ingest workflow for metadata and produces MODS xml for download following ingest ([view the spreadsheet to MODS xml mapping](/xml_mods_collections_uoft_mapping.xml))

All other details about Collections U of T metadata can be found on the [Metadata Instructions](https://utlib.github.io/collections-uoft/documentation/metadata) page.
